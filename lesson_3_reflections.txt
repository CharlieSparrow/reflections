When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - If you were collaborating with others on a project, to have a remote backup of your work, or to work from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- If you are collaborating pulling automatically could mess up your work with the work of someone else.
