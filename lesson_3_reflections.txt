When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - If you were collaborating with others on a project, to have a remote backup of your work, or to work from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- If you are collaborating pulling automatically could mess up your work with the work of someone else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- A branch is a new line off the master for saving progress for changes you dont want incorporated on the master yet. A clone is a way of coppying a repository. A Fork is a GiHub way of cloning a project onto your account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	- So that when you're making changes locally you're not creating more work than is necisary down the line by having to merge them later. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	- Probably by dropbox which would work but not be nearly as efficient because you lack all the version-control features that git offers you.
